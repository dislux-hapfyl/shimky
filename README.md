# shimky

SHell vIM tKinter pYthon = shimky

pnk.lang is a DSL made in Shell Script that compiles to Python. Abstracting indentation and category of functions into colors[capital letters] using the tag_add method from tkinter. For me it reduces cognitive load and also you write much less Python boilerplate.


shimky is the IDE for pnk.lang built in pnk.lang. It has some vim behaviors/modes/commands and an internal bash shell/command line, an mp3 player[mpv] and a youtube music downloader command line. Paste a URL and hit Ctr-n and you get a refreshed mp3 list with new mp3 renamed for POSIXish.

Launch: `sed 's|MP3_DIR=|&$HOME/your-mp3-dir/|' shimky | bash | python3 &`

Depends: `pip install pytube tk subprocess threading`

NOTE: Threading is NOT used for Subprocess.
